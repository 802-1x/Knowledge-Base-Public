### Summary

In the article 'Aiming for the Minimum of Self-Care is Dangerous', Tessa Alexanian argues that striving to minimise self-care to maximize altruistic efforts is perilous. She shares her personal experience of a mental health crisis resulting from this mindset and highlights several key points:

* The minimum is a moving target: Constantly reducing self-care can lead to an unsustainable cycle, as the threshold for 'minimum' care keeps shifting downward.
* Less than the minimum is harmful: Operating below necessary self-care levels can result in significant mental and physical health issues.
* No slack leads to breakdowns: Without adequate self-care buffers, unexpected challenges can push individuals beyond their coping capacities.
* Prioritisation over constant optimisation: Effective altruism should involve prioritising impactful actions without obsessively scrutinising every moment, allowing for a balanced and sustainable approach.

Alexanian concludes that aiming for the bare minimum in self-care is ineffective and dangerous, advocating for a more balanced approach to personal well-being and altruistic endeavours. 

Direct correlaries and applications exist in our personal life in the general context.
