The CIA Triad (Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability) is a widely recognised model in information security. However, its effectiveness as a foundational security concept has been questioned.

### Critique of the CIA Triad

* Reactive rather than proactive: The CIA Triad focuses on managing system states and mitigating impacts after security events, rather than preventing them
* Misalignment with core security principles: Security fundamentally aims to prevent crime/impact, while the CIA Triad primarily addresses system and data management

### Limitations of CIA Components
* Confidentiality: Focuses on data protection after theft, not prevention
* Integrity: Ensures data accuracy but doesn't inherently prevent tampering
* Availability: Maintains system operation but doesn't prevent disruptions

### Shifting Focus

A more effective security approach should:

* Address root causes of security threats
* Prioritise prevention of undesirable events
* Align with business objectives and understand the "why" behind protection

While the CIA Triad remains a useful framework for describing system states, it falls short of a comprehensive security strategy. A more holistic approach is needed to safeguard against modern cybersecurity threats.
