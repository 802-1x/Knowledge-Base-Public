Developed by Bruce Tuckman in 1965, this theory is formally known as 'Tuckman's Stages of Group Development' or, more commonly, 'Group Process'. An alternate more colloquial name is 'Tuckman's Ladder'. It is a well-respected and researched theory. The model outlines five stages of team development:

1. Forming: The team is formed, and members behave independently
2. Storming: Disagreements arise between team members
3. Norming: Team members accept each other, emphasising the team goal
4. Performing: The team becomes highly motivated and efficient
5. Adjourning: Tasks are completed, and the team prepares to disband

### Leadership Adaptability

Each stage requires a different leadership approach. All stages require the communication of expectations, but the method may vary:

1. Forming: Directive style to set clear goals and guidelines
2. Storming: Collaborative style to encourage open communication and resolve issues
3. Norming: Supportive style to reinforce team progress
4. Performing: Delegative style to empower the team
5. Adjourning: Empowering style to celebrate achievements and transition to new responsibilities

### Project Manager's Role

The project manager's role evolves throughout the stages:

1. Forming: Directive
2. Storming: Coaching
3. Norming: Supportive
4. Performing: Delegating
5. Adjourning: Less important than a leader's team

Overcoming Challenges

* Stuck in Storming: Implement additional conflict resolution strategies, align team members on common goals, and provide extra communication and support
* Reverting to Earlier Stages: Assess the current stage and causes of regression, then revisit previous strategies to move forward again
* Virtual Teams: Make extra efforts to build trust, facilitate communication, and enable collaboration using technology and virtual team-building activities
* Team Turnover: Integrate new members while maintaining momentum by clarifying expectations and providing mentorship

Criticisms and Alternative Theories
Gersick's (1988) 'punctuated equilibrium' model showed that not all groups go through every stage Tuckman mentions, sometimes skipping multiple stages. Action-oriented teams may not reach the norming stage, for example. More modern competing theories include:

    Kozlowski's (1999) Team Compilation Theory
    Ilges et al. (2005) Input-Mediator-Output-Input (IMOI) model

Despite these criticisms and alternative theories, Tuckman's model remains widely used and respected in understanding team development dynamics1

More modern competing theories are Kozlowski's (1999) Team Copilation Theory and Ilges et al. (2005) Input-Mediator-Output-Input (IMOI) model.

1. Forming: the team is formed, and members behave independently
2. Storming – disagreements arise between team members
Norming – team members accept each other by emphasizing the team goal
Performing – the team is highly motivated and efficient
Adjourning – tasks completed



Overcoming Challenges with the Model

* Stuck in Storming: Additional conflict resolution strategies may be needed, such as mediation, structured problem solving, or addressing root causes. Overall aligning team members on a common goal is the objective. Revisit responsibilities, goals, and guidelines to restart progress. Extra communication and support can help.
* Reverting to Earlier Stages: assess the current stage and causes of regression, then revisit previous strategies to mvoe forward again.
* Virtual Teams: make an extra effort to build trust, facilitate communication, and enable collaboration from a distance using technology and virtual team-building activities.
* Team turnover: integrate new members while maintaining momentum. Clarify exectations and provide mentorshop until dynamics become seamless again.

Some Criticisms

Gersick's (1988) 'punctuated equilibrium' model showed that not all groups go through every stage that Tuckman mentions, sometimes even skipping multiple stages. Action orientated teams may not ever hit the norming stage, for example.
