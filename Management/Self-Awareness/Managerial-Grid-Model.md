The Managerial Grid Model, developed by Robert Blake and Jane Mouton in the 1960s, is a framework for understanding and analysing leadership styles. The framework categorises leadership behaviours based on two dimensions: concern for production (tasks) and concern for people.

The model is represented as a 9x9 grid, with concern for production on the x-axis and concern for people on the y-axis, ranging from 1 (Low) to 9 (High):

This grid identifies five primary leadership styles:

1. Indifferent Style (1,1): Low concern for both people and production. Managers avoid responsibility and involvement.
2. Accommodating Style (1,9): High concern for people, low concern for production. Focuses on employee comfort and satisfaction.
3. Dictatorial Style (9,1): High concern for production, low concern for people. Emphasises rules and punishments to achieve goals.
4. Status Quo Style (5,5): Moderate concern for both people and production. Attempts to balance organisational goals and worker needs.
5. Sound Style (9,9): High concern for both people and production. Encourages teamwork and commitment, considered the most effective approach.

Two additional styles were later added:

6. Opportunistic Style: Adopts behaviour that offers the greatest personal benefit.
7. Paternalistic Style: Alternates between high concern for people and high concern for production.

The Managerial Grid Model helps leaders assess their own style, identify areas for improvement, and adapt their approach to different situations. It emphasises that the most effective leadership style (Sound Style) balances high concern for both people and productivity, fostering a collaborative and high-performing work environment.
