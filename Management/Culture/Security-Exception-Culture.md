Security policy exceptions reveal the true nature of an organisation's security culture. While some exceptions are necessary due to technical limitations, it's the discretionary exceptions that are most telling. These include:

    1. Executives accessing work email on personal devices
    2. Teams bypassing security reviews citing historical practices
    3. "Temporary" exceptions that become de facto permanent

What's most revealing isn't the written policies, but who gets to bypass them. Does seniority trump security? Are certain teams considered 'special'? (And why is it often sales?) When someone escalates to the CISO, do the rules suddenly become flexible? The reality is that some exceptions will always be necessary. The key lies in:

    1. Properly tracking exceptions
    2. Implementing a clear process for approval and review
    3. Being transparent about the risks being accepted

Every exception is a conscious decision to accept risk, so it's crucial to ensure it's done for the right reasons.

    1. What exceptions have you encountered that revealed the most about an organisation's security culture?
    2. What's your process for managing exceptions that actually works?

### A Positive Example

Jay Parikh, a Microsoft Executive Vice President, was seen with a non-standard laptop, according to the current (at the time of writing) LinkedIn CISO Lea Kissner. She questioned whether it was company-managed to avoid accidentally breaking it with security upgrades. He replied that they should never worry about breaking him (and he was indeed using a company device), demonstrating a positive attitude towards security measures.
