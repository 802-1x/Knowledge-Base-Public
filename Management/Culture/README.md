# Workplace Culture
## General Thoughts
* Workplace culture is a generally contentious and subjective topic; its importance varies significantly among individuals and organisations. Organisations are on a spectrum between weak and strong cultural emphasis.
* The primary purpose of fostering a positive workplace culture is to enhance business performance, employee satisfaction, and retention.
* Different workplace cultures appeal to different people; there's no one-size-fits-all approach that will be universally effective or appreciated.
* This concept aligns with the recruitment principle that hiring is a two-way process. A particular organisation may not be the right fit for every individual, which is not inherently problematic but rather a natural part of the job market dynamics.
* "Culture is the stories we tell." Leaders significantly influence culture through their behaviours and decisions. The responsibility for shaping and maintaining corporate culture lies primarily with management and individual contributors, not solely with Human Resources.
* It is more appropriate for the executive leadership to be accountable for culture rather than placing this burden entirely on Human Resources.
Richard Branson once said, "There's no magic formula for great company culture. The key is just to treat your staff how you would like to be treated." While the word 'just' may oversimplify the concept, the underlying principle of respect and empathy in workplace interactions is fundamental to a positive culture.
* Effective workplace culture is built upon clearly communicated principles and values that align with the organisation's missions and goals.
* Employee engagement is a direct result of a strong business culture. I would argue that employyee engagement constitutes: safety (physical, mental, social), culture, and agency/goal fulfilment (which includes remuneration).
* The stronger a organisation's culture the better employees understand what is expected of them and what they're working towards. Enbgaged and aligned employees are more likely to stay happy, motivated, and committed to the organisation.
* A high-performance culture has behaviours and norms that lead the organisation to achieve superior results by setting clear business goals, defining employees' responsbilities, creating a trusting environment, and encouraging employees to continously grow and reinvent themselves.
* High-performance cultures are supportive, positive, and proactive. They engage employees daily and attract top talent, helping organisations remain competitive and successful.
* Culture change is not easy and nearly always fails if there isn't full buy-in from the top of the organisation - it must come from the top. Culture can be localised even if the broader organisation differs.
* Managers often get broad leeway to set the cultures on their own teams, with outside intervention only if they're creating liability for the company. Some companies will intercede due to a cultural misalignment, but not always.

## "Legacy: What the All Blacks Can Teach Us About the Business of Life" by James Kerr
You certainly donâ€™t have to be a fan of rugby, or the All Blacks, to benefit from reading this gem.

This book heavily influenced my ideas about empowering groups of young athletes, and building a culture around a team, group or squad. I took notes as I read it, which is always a good indication of the impact that a book is having on the reader.
