### Train to Win
Practice under pressure. Exceptional training begets exceptional performance. If a team does no upskilling, their output will decrease over time. If a team does not practice when the pressure is off, their performance during a crisis will be suboptimal. Having the will to win is a prerequisite, but yyoui must also rpepare to win.
