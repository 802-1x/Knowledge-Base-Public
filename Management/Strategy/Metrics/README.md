### Draft Notes

If metrics can't survive a tool replacement, it was too niche (what about product monitoring?)

If reporting to the board isn't resilient to operational efficiencies, reporting has become a constraint(!!), you're doing it wrong

Don't describe metrics as practitioners value to get funded for more practitioners

Build metrics for business

Reporting against standards has longevity and avoids vendor lock-in!

It should be focussing on the outcomes of our programs of work
